Go Semaphore: Steps to Concurrency Mastery
In the semaphore implementation, we manage concurrent task execution with precision, using a semaphore to limit the number of tasks that run concurrently. Let's dive into the key steps and components of this elegant system.

Step 1: Define Your Task Structure
Start by crafting a Task struct. This struct holds an ID and a pointer to a boolean indicating whether the task has been processed, allowing us to reflect changes outside the DoWork function.

Step 2: Create the Worker with Semaphore
The WorkerWithSemaphore struct encapsulates the tasks, a results channel for communication, a semaphore channel to control concurrency, and a maximum concurrent tasks limit.

Step 3: Instantiate Your Worker
Implement a NewWorkerWithSemaphore function to create a new worker instance. It initializes the worker with a set of tasks, a semaphore channel sized to the maximum number of concurrent tasks, and a results channel.

Step 4: Execute Tasks Concurrently
Define the Work method to process tasks. For each task, the method acquires a semaphore slot, launches a goroutine for the task, and uses a sync.WaitGroup to wait for all tasks to complete.

Step 5: Task Processing Logic
Inside each goroutine, the DoWork method simulates task processing by sleeping for a random duration. This method also ensures tasks marked as processed are skipped and reports completion.

Step 6: Managing Concurrency
The semaphore channel serves as a rate limiter, ensuring that no more than the specified number of tasks run concurrently. This is crucial for resource management and preventing overload.

Step 7: Collecting Results
After all tasks are dispatched, another goroutine waits for all tasks to finish and then closes the results channel. The Results method allows for retrieving task completion statuses.

Step 8: Clean Up and Resource Management
Properly manage resources by ensuring the semaphore slots are released and the results channel is closed. This prevents leaks and ensures the system remains efficient.

Key Points to Remember:
The semaphore pattern controls the concurrency level.
Goroutines enable concurrent task execution.
Channels facilitate communication and synchronization.
sync.WaitGroup synchronizes task completion.
Proper resource management is crucial for efficiency.
Usage
Here's a sneak peek into using the Semaphore to manage task execution. Modify your main application file as follows:

go
Copy code
package main
```go
import (
	"fmt"
	"math/rand"
	"semaphore"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	rand.Seed(time.Now().UnixNano())

	// Simulate a list of tasks
	tasks := make([]*semaphore.Task, 10)
	for i := range tasks {
		processed := false
		tasks[i] = &semaphore.Task{ID: i + 1, IsProcessed: &processed}
	}

	// Create a new WorkerWithSemaphore instance
	worker := semaphore.NewWorkerWithSemaphore(tasks, 3) // Limit to 3 concurrent tasks

	// Start working on the tasks
	worker.Work()

	// Retrieve and print the results
	for result := range worker.Results() {
		fmt.Println(result)
	}
}
```
This example highlights the setup and execution process, showcasing how tasks are managed concurrently with a controlled level of concurrency for efficiency and stability. Dive in, and enjoy the concurrency mastery with Go's semaphore pattern!
